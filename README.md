### App Development Environment
* IDE and Code Editor: Xcode
* Core programming language: Swift
* UI Frameworks: UIKit & SwiftUI
* Dependency manager: Swift Package Manager
* Version control system: Git
* Hardware: Mac computer


## Installation

This section provides instructions on setting up the project on your local development environment.

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

Clone the project repository to your local machine by running the following command in the terminal:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Dream-kid/iHelp.git
cd iHelp
```

### Step 2: Setting Up the Project in Xcode
1. **Open the Project**: After cloning the repository, open the .xcodeproj file in Xcode:
2. **Install Dependencies**: Xcode should automatically fetch the dependencies with Swift Package Manager. If it doesn't, you can manually fetch and update the packages by navigating to: `Xcode > File > Swift Packages > Update to Latest Package Versions`

### Step 3:  Configuring Signing and Provisioning
Each target in the project (main app and extensions) requires specific signing and provisioning settings:
1. **Select the Team**: In Xcode's General tab for each target, select the appropriate team from the "Team" dropdown.
2. **Manage Signing**:
   - **Automatic**: For automatic signing, check "Automatically manage signing" and ensure the correct team is selected.
   - **Manual**: For manual signing, uncheck "Automatically manage signing" and select the specific provisioning profiles for each target, aligned with their bundle identifiers and capabilities.

### Step 4: Run the Project
Select your target device or simulator from the Xcode toolbar. Then, press the Run button (â–¶) to build and run the project.
